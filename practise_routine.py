        If chosen Instrumental performers:
        {instrumental_performers}

        The routine should include:
        1. A warm-up session inspired by appropriate techniques for {practice_type}. If chosen vocal, make sure you include breathing exercises, help explanding the vocal cords. 
        2. Main practice activities tailored to the practice type, proficiency level, and incorporating elements from top performers' styles without giving unncecssary details about the performers and their styles. 
        3. Focused practice sessions for each selected focus area, drawing inspiration from relevant top performers
        4. A cool-down session
        5. Specific exercises or techniques for each part of the routine, reflecting best practices in Carnatic music

        Please provide a step-by-step routine with time allocations for each activity, ensuring it fits within the total practice time of {practice_time} minutes.
